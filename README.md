🚗 Traffic Accident Data Analysis
📌 Overview
This project is part of my internship at SkillCraft Technologies, where I analyzed traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.

🎯 Objective
Explore how road conditions, weather, and time of day impact accident frequency and severity.
Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and categorical encoding.
Visualize accident trends and patterns using charts and heatmaps.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (Optional: Predictive Modeling)
🔍 Key Analysis Areas
✅ Time-based Analysis – Examined accident trends by hour, day, and month.
✅ Weather Impact – Identified accident patterns under different weather conditions.
✅ Road Conditions – Analyzed how road types and conditions contribute to accident severity.
✅ Geospatial Visualization – (Optional) Mapped accident hotspots using Folium or Plotly.
